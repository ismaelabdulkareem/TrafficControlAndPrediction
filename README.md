Globally, cities are experiencing an increase in traffic congestion. Growing 
urban populations, lack of maintenance, inadequate public transportation, 
Poor Driving Habits, Weather conditions, and accidents are all contributing 
factors. 
This project aims to predict traffic congestion by implementing a machine
learning pipeline using two different regression models: Random Forest 
Regressor (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Furthermore, 
Compare their performance on a dataset that is used to train and evaluate 
these models, and the evaluation is based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
metric.
